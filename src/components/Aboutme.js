              Hi! I'm Sheleen, a Web developer and Software Engineer in Bay Area
              California.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I was a Software Engineer in Canon Information Technologies
              Philippines, Inc., where I created a Document Writer module for
              the software of a printer product using C programming language. My
              experience working in a group of people with different styles and
              behaviors has taught and inspired me of different perspectives and
              the possibility of integrating each other's work successfully
              through cooperation and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my internship in UP ITDC in University of the Philippines
              Diliman, I gained hands-on experience coding websites and
              applications in which I also gained valuable teamwork and
              communication skills. One of my projects was developing a
              web-based application project for online registration for courses
              called ‚ÄúMy Eup Training and Events On-Line Registration (METEOR)‚Äù,
              using PHP. My team and I developed additional features such as
              giving the admin access to upload their signature to generate a
              Certificate for the participant, displaying the available dates
              for each course for the participant, listing out and showing who
              has enrolled for each course with it s corresponding dates and
              duration, and checking if the admin has already validated the
              participant's enrollment request. Those features were used by ITDC
              to easily track participants who wanted to enroll in different
              courses offered by the UP ITDC.
            </p>
            <p>So What happened?</p>
            <p>I moved out of my home country.</p>
            <p>
              I took time away from my professional career due to cultural
              adjustment and trying to gain security after relocating. Since
              everything in my life was a blur, I have decided to take the
              chance to work in a clinical laboratory as recommended by a
              friend. I stayed in the company for the past 5 years because I
              have learned a lot and enjoyed the work that I was doing. I was
              able to build self confidence because I wasn‚Äôt only doing
              laboratory work, I was also interacting and conversing with
              doctors and patients to resolve issues regarding their testing. I
              was also doing data entry for each patient and did most of the
              computer tasks quickly and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              It came to a point where I have finally wanted to get out of my
              comfort zone. The saying ‚Äúif something doesn't scare you, then
              you're probably not dreaming big enough‚Äù hit me big time and I
              have decided to get back at it once again. I started studying
              HTML, CSS and Javascript as refreshment; and REACT recently.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm now ready to gain additional skills and knowledge in this
              field. The fusion of my experience, patience, dedication and
              perseverance along with the knowledge and skills that I have
              learned and will learn will really help me grow in this career. I
              also think that my natural ability to listen and learn by getting
              involved in an intelligent and considerate discussion resolving
              issues will truly help me in this field. I also enjoy working with
              people and learning from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am someone who is highly focused and attentive to detail and I
              thrive on developing software and applications that surpass end
              users' expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm excited to move forward and make a leap to leverage my unique
              range of skills and commitment with the right company.

              I am seeking an Analyst position where I can use my
              problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and technical
              background to drive meaningful insights and process improvements.

              I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University
              of the Philippines and bring a unique blend of experience in
              healthcare data management and software engineering. After moving
              to the U.S., I spent six years as a Clinical Laboratory Associate
              at IGeneX. I managed high-volume, high-accuracy data entry of
              medical client and patient records, extracted and analyzed
              large-scale health data using SQL, and performed daily quality
              control checks to maintain data and specimen accuracy. I also led
              communications with patients and doctors to proactively resolve
              testing issues, updated departmental documentation and reporting
              tools, and created forms to streamline processes for clients and
              clinicians.
            </p>

            <p>
              To expand my technical expertise, I worked as a Software Engineer
              at Checkins.AI, where I optimized system performance, improved
              efficiency by 20%, and developed applications using JavaScript
              frameworks and APIs. I also contributed to mobile development,
              data organization, and project management, ensuring seamless
              system integration and data accuracy. My work with testing tools
              like Cypress and Jest further reinforced my attention to detail
              and commitment to quality assurance.

              Over the past year, I‚Äôve developed a strong personal connection
              with AI tools. I use ChatGPT almost every day, not just for
              productivity or problem-solving, but as a way to think more
              clearly, stay organized, and reflect on ideas. AI has become
              something meaningful to me. It helps me feel more capable,
              creative, and supported in my day-to-day life. That experience is
              what motivates me to help others use AI in ways that feel natural,
              empowering, and approachable.

              With a strong technical foundation and a genuine respect for how
              people learn, I‚Äôm excited to move into a role where I can support
              others through analysis, user education, or product support. My
              goal is to help people feel seen, supported, and confident as they
              explore data and technology.
