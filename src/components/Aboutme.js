              Hi! I'm Sheleen, a Web developer and Software Engineer in Bay Area
              California.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I was a Software Engineer in Canon Information Technologies
              Philippines, Inc., where I created a Document Writer module for
              the software of a printer product using C programming language. My
              experience working in a group of people with different styles and
              behaviors has taught and inspired me of different perspectives and
              the possibility of integrating each other's work successfully
              through cooperation and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my internship in UP ITDC in University of the Philippines
              Diliman, I gained hands-on experience coding websites and
              applications in which I also gained valuable teamwork and
              communication skills. One of my projects was developing a
              web-based application project for online registration for courses
              called ‚ÄúMy Eup Training and Events On-Line Registration (METEOR)‚Äù,
              using PHP. My team and I developed additional features such as
              giving the admin access to upload their signature to generate a
              Certificate for the participant, displaying the available dates
              for each course for the participant, listing out and showing who
              has enrolled for each course with it s corresponding dates and
              duration, and checking if the admin has already validated the
              participant's enrollment request. Those features were used by ITDC
              to easily track participants who wanted to enroll in different
              courses offered by the UP ITDC.
            </p>
            <p>So What happened?</p>
            <p>I moved out of my home country.</p>
            <p>
              I took time away from my professional career due to cultural
              adjustment and trying to gain security after relocating. Since
              everything in my life was a blur, I have decided to take the
              chance to work in a clinical laboratory as recommended by a
              friend. I stayed in the company for the past 5 years because I
              have learned a lot and enjoyed the work that I was doing. I was
              able to build self confidence because I wasn‚Äôt only doing
              laboratory work, I was also interacting and conversing with
              doctors and patients to resolve issues regarding their testing. I
              was also doing data entry for each patient and did most of the
              computer tasks quickly and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              It came to a point where I have finally wanted to get out of my
              comfort zone. The saying ‚Äúif something doesn't scare you, then
              you're probably not dreaming big enough‚Äù hit me big time and I
              have decided to get back at it once again. I started studying
              HTML, CSS and Javascript as refreshment; and REACT recently.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm now ready to gain additional skills and knowledge in this
              field. The fusion of my experience, patience, dedication and
              perseverance along with the knowledge and skills that I have
              learned and will learn will really help me grow in this career. I
              also think that my natural ability to listen and learn by getting
              involved in an intelligent and considerate discussion resolving
              issues will truly help me in this field. I also enjoy working with
              people and learning from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am someone who is highly focused and attentive to detail and I
              thrive on developing software and applications that surpass end
              users' expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm excited to move forward and make a leap to leverage my unique
              range of skills and commitment with the right company.
            </p>
            <p>Wish me luck! üòÄ </p>
